## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Load in our 3 season we're going to be using for the Marcel Method

names(season_1718)

Things to note: In order to complete Marcel projections I need 1) Season weights (I'm sticking with 5/4/3) 2) I'll need to find each players average in the relevant seasons 3) I'll need to find the league average for F/D in each category 4) Regress the player usiong the league average at their position 5) Determine their projected TOI 6) Apply age adjustment 7) adjust based on 2020 baseline


## Finding the league averages for the stats we're going to use is the first order of business:
