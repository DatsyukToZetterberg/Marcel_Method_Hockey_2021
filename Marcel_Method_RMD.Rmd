Load in our 3 season we're going to be using for the Marcel Method

names(season_1718)

Things to note: In order to complete Marcel projections I need 1) Season weights (I'm sticking with 5/4/3) 2) I'll need to find each players average in the relevant seasons 3) I'll need to find the league average for F/D in each category 4) Regress the player using the league average at their position 5) Determine their projected TOI 6) Apply age adjustment 7) adjust based on 2020 baseline


## Finding the league averages for the stats we're going to use is the first order of business:
