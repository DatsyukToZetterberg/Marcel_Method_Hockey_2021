n3 = pred_year-3
n2 = pred_year-2
n1 = pred_year-1


Load in the seasons you'll be using and add in the season var.

Things to note: In order to complete Marcel projections I need 1) Season weights (I'm sticking with 5/4/3) 2) I'll need to find each players average in the relevant seasons 3) I'll need to find the league average for F/D in each category 4) Regress the player using the league average at their position 5) Determine their projected TOI 6) Apply age adjustment 7) adjust based on 2020 baseline


## Finding the league averages for the stats we're going to use is the first order of business:
